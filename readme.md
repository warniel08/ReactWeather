# React Weather Application

This is a weather application built on React. It was built from "The Complete React Web Developer Course" from [udemy.com](http://udemy.com)'s Andrew Mead.

## Here are some of the tools I used: 
  * [React](https://facebook.github.io/react) - I used React for the JavaScript framework.
  * [Open Weather Map](http://openweathermap.org) - I used Open Weather Map to search for current weather data by city name.
  * [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) - I used Foundation for CSS styling to make this app look nice.
